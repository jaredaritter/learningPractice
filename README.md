# learningPractice

This repository is solely intended as an area to practice and familiarize myself with git and github characteristics. Let's see if we can make some mistakes and learn.

Basic understanding of uploads complete. Time to use github to store project files and pull, modify, and push to repository. Bootstrap image gallery good option for trial.

Note: Initially planned on going through git to access github. Finding that git knowledge limited and slowing progress from webdev time. For time, being will access github directly through website and continue learning git during tool training time.

Finding: Uploading file with same name overwrites old file with same name without warning or checks. Commit as branch unless certain.

Finding: Git: git init in desired directory otherwise all files in current directory will be included and VSCode will yell at you. 

Projects: Up until 6/10/19 project build with bootstrap 3.3.7 as that is what course was using. Projects introduced beginning 6/11/19 wil be build using bootstrap 4.3 while being taught with 4.0. Initially I was going to skip 4.0 since bootstrap is useful but not essential, but since flexbox will be covered I will at least work through some of it for a more current understanding of state of HTML and CSS.

Projects (Update): Bootstrap 4 + Flexbox syntax somewhat confusing but allows for rapid building and tweaking of layout. Seems to be significant improvement.
